-----Geometric modelling of gear tooth through b-spline-----

1)firstly open the all three codes mentioned in the 'program' folder that     are:
   -knots
   -geartoothformula
   -spline

2)Now,run the 'spline' file.
    the figure so obtained is the gear profile which is involute in nature     generated through formulas.

3)The program then ask  for order of curve(this is for spline)
    -enter order<=no.of points which is 28,otherwise a error dialogue will      appear.

4)Then, on the same figure the tooth profile through b-spline is also     generated and compared relatively.
                                                                                   --the end--
